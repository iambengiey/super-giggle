# Service levels

- **Emergency:** immediate triage and escalation.
- **Urgent:** target initial response within one business day.
- **Routine:** scheduled by queue, access, and supplier availability.

## Important notes

- Response times are targets, not guarantees.
- Resolution time depends on approvals, parts, access, and specialist contractor availability.
- Life-threatening emergencies must go to public emergency services first.
