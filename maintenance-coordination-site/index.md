# Friendly maintenance coordination for your complex

We help landlords and managing agents keep maintenance organised, transparent, and calm.

<div class="chips" aria-label="Severity levels">
  <span class="chip chip-emergency">Emergency</span>
  <span class="chip chip-urgent">Urgent</span>
  <span class="chip chip-routine">Routine</span>
</div>

## How it works

1. Tenant selects the correct complex page.
2. Tenant logs the issue through the Google Form.
3. Team triages and coordinates by severity.
4. Landlord or agent receives structured updates.
