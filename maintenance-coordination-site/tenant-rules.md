# Tenant rules

- Use the official Google Form for every maintenance issue.
- Do not phone contractors.
- Do not phone owners for maintenance logging.
- Do not WhatsApp maintenance issues.
- For life-threatening emergencies, call <a href="tel:10111">SAPS 10111</a> or <a href="tel:112">112 (mobile)</a>.

## Verification and operational matching

Maintenance requests are verified against the managing agent tenant register (unit and mobile number). The complex is inferred operationally during this verification process.

## Privacy notice (summary)

We collect unit, name, mobile number, and photos only as needed to process maintenance. This website does not store tenant submissions. Requests are submitted via Google Forms/Drive and may be verified against managing agent records.
