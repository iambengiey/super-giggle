# How it works

## For tenants

- Open the Tenant page.
- Click **Log a maintenance issue**.
- Submit clear details and photos where possible.
- Requests are verified against the managing agent register (unit + mobile).

## For landlords and agents

- Receive cleaner intake information.
- Prioritise incidents consistently.
- Keep records centralised without sharing contractor numbers with tenants.
