# Repository Rules

- Do not store personal data or tenant PII in the repository.
- Do not publish contractor phone numbers anywhere on the site.
- Use British English spelling and a calm, friendly, factual tone.
- Keep implementation simple (static Jekyll pages, minimal complexity).
- Always distinguish:
  - life-threatening emergencies (public emergency services), and
  - maintenance emergencies (urgent building incidents).
- GBV support content must remain discreet, factual, and direct users to official services.
